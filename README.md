Working with Naive Baye Classifier

This is a NaÃ¯ve Baye Classifier I used to sort anonymously submitted text messages submitted by Students at San Diego State University. The messages used for training were taken during the Winter term of 2017

---WARNING---
These are anonymously submitted messages by college students. The key words I used, along with the training data contain lude or 
inappropriate material.
